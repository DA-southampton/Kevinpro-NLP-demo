you re a fool
you ve been listening to rumors

you won t
hardly a reason to run off with a murderer
just a little crazy
that would be difficult to explain
i d like you to try
he is older than i
perhaps  there is something more an inheritance
you killed those other two
not the same

yes he has a long journey ahead
mr scott we need everything you ve got now

i went wrong
it s snow snow in the same sector fantastic
a photon tube
short range scan
radiation residual level is minimal
my readings indicate great instability
spock s burial robe
grissom your message acknowledged will advise out
logic indicates that is the case
why don t you just call for uhelpu
i have already made one transmission too many
did your collaborator know
and spock with it they are joined together

to be sure captain
the power of creation
have they proceeded with their experiments
chekov s on reliant isn t he
it would explain a great many things
who the uhellu are they
it s all we ve got
a distinct possibility
not much admiral we have partial main power
that s it
best we could do in two hours
steady as you go
uhura patch me in
or the one
transmission jammed at the source sir
because there was no way to win
it is still regulation admiral
i did not think so
you may ask lieutenant
energize defense fields
phasers on stun move out
the ukobayashi maruu sir
no uncoded messages on an open channel
they just don t want us going in there
all stop sir
descend ten thousand meters stand by photon torpedoes
power levels quite low sir
two minutes ten seconds
engine room what s happening
distance from reliant
as you were mr saavik
engage warp engines
best guess mr sulu fire when ready
project parabolic course to avoid entering neutral zone
now entering the neutral zone
aft thrusters sir
course heading captain
no power to the weapons system sir
what did you expect lieutenant
he s very human
thank you mr saavik
you are half human the computer knows that
the question is irrelevant
to earth to offer testimony
you do this  for friendship
i do this because i was there
they do indeed
just a couple of kooks
fine just fine
indeed may i offer you gentlemen anything
a moment alone please
what do you mean

hamlet act i scene 4
acceleration is no longer a constant
guessing is not in my nature

jim spock jim remember
to the onboard computer room to confirm my suspicion
in progress admiral
uhura get me through to starfleet command
what is our target in time

surely you can be more specific
nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels
you don t have to lie you could exaggerate
the hell i can t
what else did you learn from your mind meld
thank you spock
no admiral but is the human thing to do
right  will you help us
they did admiral

wing to cruise configuration full impulse power
ground cushion keep the nose up if you can
overlapping distress calls some from starships others

good let s begin to move these people out
i believe it is safe sir

according to our astrometric readings the year is 2063
i am the borg
i told you there s no
oh just a little tinkering how is he

they re converting the deflector dish into an antennae
just a little queasy
where the hell are they going
what are you suggesting
something is very wrong commander we re falling back
commander we have a problem
i m going too they may need a doctor
the charge is murder
vulcans sleep lying down
we do sleep lying down
that s the question
i wish i knew uhura
we re not finished
speak for yourself one day one night
that was the general idea i intended to convey
i didn t mean this future
are we playing multiple choice
still think we re finished
more than ever
no way  you see this
spock s looking for us
killed trying to escape  it s a classic
captain shall we attempt to return fire
in space no one can hear you sweat
we were until your torpedoes
then let me help
that s a comfort
i m not sure how to take that
you feign ignorance
how can i trust
take them away
and what did they tell you

i don t believe this
i m hesitant to
mack the mouth at a loss for words
i was visiting an old college friend
you didn t tell anyone where you were

there was talk of a file photo
in ft myers before your instruction nowhere else sir
i need to get to amarillo immediately

suspect zero is a crackpot theory you said so
the little piggie speaks

obviously there was
and you didn t try to find out who
i believe agnes is different
from other nuns  yes i i ve noticed
no not in the eyes of the police
and in your eyes
i ve already told you what i thought
that possibility never occurred to you
noone knew about agnes  pregnancy noone not even agnes
and you weren t shocked
i was appalled just as you are now
and what happened
she stopped eating completely
about two years before
i hate ignorance and stupidity
the catholic church
oh some time in january

i have a few more questions to ask her
my god but you re determined

was it you
is it because she s a nun
did you know she was pregnant
i didn t guess until it was too late
for what  an abortion
oh don t be ridiculous
too late for what
i don t know too late to stop it

that s nice
geniuses don t need good luck  i do
i m a junk yard

how is eve okay
i ll check with eve
it won t play
cut it out
when i m guest of honor
i had no idea you were even here
it s a pretty rare quality these days
she s a girl of so many rare qualities
so she seems
for instance  you
you know nothing about feelings natural or unnatural
what s all over
you wouldn t understand  how was miss caswell
i wouldn t be surprised sometimes you frighten me
i mix what i like
i will not calm down
don t calm down
you re being terribly tolerant aren t you
i m trying terribly hard
i ve been aware of that for some time
well i am
i ll say
don t be condescending
the terms are too high unconditional surrender
then what would be enough  if we were married
that suddenly makes the whole thing believable
you were great
what would you like texas
with the paper to prove it
eve eve harrington
just wondered what
i don t have to i want to
is it the money
eighty percent of it will go for taxes
it s only one picture deal
so few come back
also addison dewitt

so am i
what have i got to do with it
from what would i be running
and for you
you re quite a girl
no thanks birdie
a diamond collar gold sleeves  you know picture people
i never played fort sumter
imagine all this admiration in just one room
see you home
do you want an argument or an answer
she works hard
night an  day
she s loyal and efficient
like an agent with one client
she thinks only for me   doesn t she
don t be dense the party
i  i guess i fell asleep
that s all
what report to whom
i ll just pick up the broken glass
don t bother
with changing and everything a little over an hour
you rest i ll get it
he s the best
not at all  margo this is eve harrington
it couldn t possibly interest you
not just that way as a friend
i d like that
i think she would cheer
but mr richards and mr sampson
they ll do as they re told
i won t forget
don t bother i can take it up myself
they certainly don t waste much time
nothing definite yet  it s just to have lunch
i don t intend to be
can t we sit down just for a minute
oh but there is
i m not crying
an understudy s performance
he can help you
something most important you can do
over my dead body
how do you do mr richards
i hope so mr richards good night
not with you in them not by mr richards
i won t be a minute
the curtains i made them myself
they are lovely aren t they lovely birdie
yes dear you forgot all about it

roughly ten minutes
how far to the station
three or four miles
it doesn t matter
i detest cheap sentiment
we ve all seemed a little tense lately
what about bill
he s in love with you
isn t that what they always say
if we could cast it properly that is
they d die without each other
nothing much she apologized
did miss harrington tell you to call mr richards
among so many quiet qualities
up in the room
the play all right i guess
cora she s  still a girl of twenty
twentyish it isn t important
don t be evasive
margo you haven t got any age
miss channing is ageless spoken like a press agent
eve eve my understudy but i had no idea
i m sure
she was a revelation
to you too
what do you mean
i have no intention of having an accident
thank you lloyd godspeed
you know she probably means well after all
she is a louse
i don t think i could be
well i don t want to play cora
